## General info
Personal Repository to train and learn C++/C by designing and implementing projects, the goal is to create a different project every month with the goal of learning from different programming fields. Other languages could be present such as 
Python to improve some of the projects. 

This repository started as a place where I uploaded very small files containing code for an easy task. Now as i have mentioned before, I am trying to work on a new project every month so you will find different kinds of projects which will be focused on different topics. Some will be more sofisticated while other will just be a first approach to some field where I will maybe focus some projects later on.

I hope this repository provides inspiration for anyone who wants to learn and represents my passion on programming.
