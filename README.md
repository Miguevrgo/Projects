## General info
Personal Repository to train and learn Programming by designing and implementing projects, the goal is to create a different project every month with the goal of learning from different programming fields, Mainly in C++/Python/Rust. Other languages could be present to improve some of the projects. 

This repository started as a place where I uploaded very small files containing code for an easy task. Now as i have mentioned before, I am trying to work on a new project every month so you will find different kinds of projects which will be focused on different topics. Some will be more sophisticated while other will just be a first approach to some field where I will maybe focus some projects later on.

I hope this repository provides inspiration for anyone who wants to learn and represents my passion on programming.
