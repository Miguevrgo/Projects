# Ridmaze

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a modern C++ 2D Game using SFML

## Implementation Details

The spell checker is built with a focus on performance and simpliicity. POO methodology is used.

## Usage

Just clone the repository and compile with the given CmakeList file, you can easily explore the different files as there are not many and the name is quite descriptive. As the project will not 
be updated and its not finished a simple game is implemented with a maze and a player that can move around with the arrow keys going from one level to another avoiding the walls and monsters.

To play, just use hjkl or the arrow keys to move around the maze and try to reach the end of the level, you can press ENTER key to start the game.
