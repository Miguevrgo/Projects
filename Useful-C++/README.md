This project is just a bunch of useful C++ Algorithms I want to have 
stored somewhere to use them whenever needed, the algorithms are famous,
and often used, so maximum performance and simplicity is seeked, 
most of them are programmed by me or read from somewhere so not credit nor
license should be used, just use one as I do if you need.
