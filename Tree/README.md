# Tree

## Objective 

The aim of this project is to develop a modern C++ template in order for anyone to be 
able to use a binary tree structure in their project of choice

## Features

- **Templates**: It has been developed using STL to ensure that any type of data can be used 
in the tree
- **Memory Leaks**: It uses unique_ptr so that memory leaks are less error-prone
## Implementation Details

The tree Data structure is built with the aim of learning and allowing other people to
learn, it isnÂ´t the best implementation, however, it provides efficient, safe and 
easy code for simple use.

## Usage

Just clone the repository, or download the files, then you can add tree to your /usr/include
directory or just to your project in order to use it

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's correcting bugs, adding features
